Just start it. After a moment you can find a new song (each run different melody) in the output folder (where the script is).

Btw. not every song is great but most of them. ;-)





Some Notes: 

The reason for some strange melodic songs is that i dont want the script to get uncreative at all, some uncommon notes are great in a specific context (just delete the worth songs);

How ever i would suggest to play the songs using the Protracker / Noisetracker / StarTrekker (by FLT) on a Amiga Computer or the Protracker 2 Clone / VLC using the Amiga Mod Player extension for Windows 10/11.
